# Tagged Base64 Converter

Tagged Base64 Converter is a simple web app for encoding and decoding information in Tagged Base64 format. It is intended to be practical, but also to be a clear example of a web interface to a Rust library.

## Technologies Used
www
Several tools and libraries are used in this project.

### WebAssembly from Rust

WebAssembly (Wasm) provides the means for JavaScript to use Rust in the browser. The tooling for compiling Rust to Wasm and creating wrappers for JavaScript was first released in 2018 and still feels somewhat new, but interoperation between Rust and JavaScript works well for simple things like this.

For more complex Rust WebAssembly projects, there are challenges
- Many otherwise suitable Rust crates assume the standard library will be available; Wasm is more like an embedded target
- Asynchronous code is tricky in one language, and even more so in two
- Not all Rust types are supported
- Memory management is primitive
- Error handling is pretty good but not seamless
- The browser Wasm sandbox has security restrictions
- Debugging support is primitive
- Needed tools are not entirely integrated into Cargo, Node.js, and webpack
- Unless you already know how to develop in both languages, the documentation may not give you everything you need

As your needs grow, you'll find some useful stuff in https://github.com/rustwasm

### TaggedBase64, Base64, and CRC8

TaggedBase64 uses Base64 and CRC8. Base64 encoding was invented in the 90's to send binary data over channels that only reliably transmitted text. CRC8 is a common error-detecting code and is used here to make it possible to detect transcription and transmission errors.

### Node.js and npm

Node.js and npm are used to
- Set up the initial web project
- Serve the assets locally
- Execute tests

The configuration file `package.json` points to the wasm-related resources.

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used to interface with Rust and present a form user interface in a web browser.

No big libraries or frameworks such as jquery or React are used to keep this project as simple and broadly applicable as possible while showcasing Rust in the browser.

[webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) provides a convenient developement environment because it reloads web assets when they are changed, so usually it is not necessary to restart the web server. It's not intended for production, however.

## Setup

- [Install or update Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [update npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm)
- cargo install wasm-pack
- wasm-pack build
- (cd www && npm install)
- (cd www && NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm start)

## Development

When you change the Rust code, you need to use wasm-pack build to recreate the .wasm and wrappers.

When you motify the JavaScript or HTML, things may reload automatically. Otherwise, kill and rerun npm run start and reload the browser window.
- (cd www && NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm run start)

wasm-pack inherits an issue from webpack. A change to OpenSSL left a hash algorithm deprecated. Webpack is planning to migrate to a different function for webpack 6. Meanwhile, setting the environment variable NODE_OPTIONS gets us past an error in wasm-pack.

https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532

package.json tells NPM where to find things including the Wasm bytecodes and the JavaScript wrappers.

If you want to create your own project without copying this one, you can use a template. The only thing the template does over a straight copy is to substitute the project/directory name and author names in a few places.

- cargo install cargo-generate
- cargo generate --git https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template 

- Setup an NPM package directory in `www`
- npm init wasm-app www
- This creates the following files
  - bootstrap.js
  - index.html
  - index.js
  - LICENSE-APACHE
  - LICENSE-MIT
  - package.json
  - package-lock.json
  - README.md
  - webpack.config.js

## Troubleshooting NPM

If NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider isn't set, `npm run start` will fail and the errors can be a bit mystifying.

## Testing

UI testing is performed manually following [Testing Tagged Base64 Converter
](test-procedure.md). Automated testing of the Rust entry points is performed by running

```shell
wasm-pack test --node
```
The test output looks something like this
```shell

```

This web interface is so simple it doesn't have extensive tests of its own, relying on TaggedBase64's extensive tests.
